# Architecture Committee Election Results: September 2019

Three nominations were received for the March 2019 elections:

- [`Eric Ernst`](https://github.com/sameo)
- [`Xaomin Tsai`](https://github.com/jshachm)
- [`Justin He`](https://github.com/justin-he)

As the number of applications matched the number of available seats, the
question and voting phases of the elections were bypassed, and the two
applicants were admitted to the Architecture Committee on 2019-09-12
for another 12 month term.
