Background:
 
I am a Senior Software Engineer working for Red Hat's virtualization team, a
tattoo canvas for abstract art, a music addict, and a big fan of old video
games.
 
In the past 6 months I have been dedicating a big chunk of my time contributing
and helping to make the Kata Containers project solid across different
communities, such as Fedora, CentOS, and CRI-O, supporting Kata Containers
exposure and adoption in the enterprise Linux world.

My involvement with Kata Containers has been quite intense in this period,
from providing simple patches, doing code reviews on pretty much all
components, fixing issues not only on Kata Containers but also in the
communities surrounding the project, to becoming a point of contact for Fedora,
CentOS, and RHEL related issues, always focusing on what could benefit the
project and its community.

To keep improving Kata Containers adoption, I recently became the CRI-O
maintainer for the VM runtime type (used together with the "shim v2") and I am
and will be enforcing Kata Containers play well also with one of the most
widely used container runtimes in the Kubernetes ecosystem.

My primary interest is to ensure that Kata Containers can be used in enterprise
Linux solutions, which can be achieved by improving stability, debuggability,
and out-of-the-box usage, everything done as a symbiotic process with an
organic growth. Enforcing this growth will fundamentally benefit this community
and the communities around this one.

In order to make it possible, I plan to continue working in the integration
bits, while keeping connecting and facilitating the communication between the 
Kata Containers community and the communities that both Red Hat and I are part
of.

The contributions I have participated in and I am the most proud to mention
are:

* Out-of-the-box virtio-fs support on Fedora, and CentOS;
* Helping with the SELinux support on Kata Containers, CRI-O, and
  container-selinux projects;
* Helping to educate & to onboard colleagues to the project, assisting them so
  they can get up to speed to start contributing with different pieces and also
  to become part of this community; 
* Helping to lower the maintenance burden by dropping OBS package builds in
  favor of kata-deploy usage (still in progress).
